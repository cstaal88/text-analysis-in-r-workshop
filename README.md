# text-analysis-in-r-workshop
An introduction to basic text analysis in R

These workshop materials are based on a workshop I conducted for a group of doctoral students at UT Austin in April 2023. The slidedeck introduces some basic concepts that are useful to know when getting started with text analysis in R. The "Activity 1" notebook goes over how these concepts work in R. "Activity 2" then provides the options of applying what you learn in Activity 1. 

In short, you'll learn:
* How to look through a dataset to find messages containing a specific word or list of words.
* How to find out which words are most frequently used in a dataset.
* How to visualize word frequencies using bar charts and word clouds.
